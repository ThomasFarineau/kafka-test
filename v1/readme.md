For the moment, I have literally done what was noted in the comments, but in truth, there are things to modify because creating a group in the consumer and making it subscribe to topics in the same program is not necessarily very interesting. I mean, personally, I would have split it into two files in order to put the group creation and topic subscription part in one, and the consumer part in another where it will just connect to a group.
